# WPanelToolkit
A collection of panels for WPF.

## FillGrid
A control which puts its elements into a grid, attempting to give each element equal size. If the grid is non-rectangular the last row of elements will be stretched to fill the space (this is the difference between this panel and the built-in `UniformGrid`).
